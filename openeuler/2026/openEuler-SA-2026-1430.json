      "Text": "HSQLdb is a relational database engine written in JavaTM , with a JDBC driver, supporting a subset of ANSI-92 SQL. It offers a small (about 100k), fast database engine which offers both in memory and disk based tables. Embedded and server modes are available. Additionally, it includes tools such as a minimal web server, in-memory query and management tools (can be run as applets or servlets, too) and a number of demonstration examples. Downloaded code should be regarded as being of production quality. The product is currently being used as a database and persistence engine in many Open Source Software projects and even in commercial projects and products! In it\u0026apos;s current version it is extremely stable and reliable. It is best known for its small size, ability to execute completely in memory and its speed. Yet it is a completely functional relational database management system that is completely free under the Modified BSD License. Yes, that\u0026apos;s right, completely free of cost or restrictions!\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in the Libreoffice package. An attacker can craft an odb containing a \"database/script\" file with a SCRIPT command where the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose location was determined by the attacker.(CVE-2023-1183)",
