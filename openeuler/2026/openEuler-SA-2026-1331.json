Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function Assimp::AC3DImporter::ConvertObjectSection of the file code/AssetLib/AC/ACLoader.cpp of the component AC3D File Handler.
