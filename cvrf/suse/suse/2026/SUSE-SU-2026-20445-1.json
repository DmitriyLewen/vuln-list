An attacker who can control the input for the Content-Disposition header can inject CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences into the header value. These sequences are then interpreted verbatim when the HTTP request or response is constructed, allowing arbitrary HTTP headers to be injected. This vulnerability can lead to HTTP header injection or HTTP response splitting without requiring authentication or user interaction.",

A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted multipart HTTP response, which can lead to memory corruption. This issue may result in application crashes or arbitrary code execution in applications that process untrusted server responses, and it does not require authentication or user interaction.",
