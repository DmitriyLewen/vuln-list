If a non-default configuration is used where the maximum incoming payload size is unset, the library may read memory outside the intended bounds. This can cause unintended memory exposure or a crash. Applications using libsoup's WebSocket support with this configuration may be impacted.",

      "Description": "A flaw was identified in the NTLM authentication handling of the libsoup HTTP library, used by GNOME and other applications for network communication. When processing extremely long passwords, an internal size calculation can overflow due to improper use of signed integers. This results in incorrect memory allocation on the stack, followed by unsafe memory copying. As a result, applications using libsoup may crash unexpectedly, creating a denial-of-service risk.",
