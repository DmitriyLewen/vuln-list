Prior to versions 9.0.2, 8.1.6, 8.0.7, and 7.2.12, a malicious actor with access to the Valkey clusterbus port can send an invalid packet that may cause an out bound read, which might result in the system crashing. The Valkey clusterbus packet processing code does not validate that a clusterbus ping extension packet is located within buffer of the clusterbus packet before attempting to read it. Versions 9.0.2, 8.1.6, 8.0.7, and 7.2.12 fix the issue. As an additional mitigation, don't expose the cluster bus connection directly to end users, and protect the connection with its own network ACLs.",

      "Description": "Valkey is a distributed key-value database. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 9.0.3, a malicious actor with network access to Valkey can cause the system to abort by triggering an assertion. When processing incoming requests, the Valkey system does not properly reset the networking state after processing an empty request. A malicious actor can then send a request that the server incorrectly identifies as breaking server side invariants, which results in the server shutting down. Version 9.0.3 fixes the issue. As an additional mitigation, properly isolate Valkey deployments so that only trusted users have access.",
