      "CVE": "CVE-2026-25547",
      "Description": "@isaacs/brace-expansion is a hybrid CJS/ESM TypeScript fork of brace-expansion. Prior to version 5.0.1, @isaacs/brace-expansion is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) issue caused by unbounded brace range expansion. When an attacker provides a pattern containing repeated numeric brace ranges, the library attempts to eagerly generate every possible combination synchronously. Because the expansion grows exponentially, even a small input can consume excessive CPU and memory and may crash the Node.js process. This issue has been patched in version 5.0.1.",
