      "Text": "This update for mosquitto fixes the following issues:\n\nChanges in mosquitto:\n\n- update to 2.0.23 (boo#1258671)\n  * Fix handling of disconnected sessions for `per_listener_settings\n    true`\n  * Check return values of openssl *_get_ex_data() and\n    *_set_ex_data() to prevent possible crash. This could occur only\n    in extremely unlikely situations\n  * Check return value of openssl ASN1_string_[get0_]data()\n    functions for NULL. This prevents a crash in case of incorrect\n    certificate handling in openssl\n  * Fix potential crash on startup if a malicious/corrupt\n    persistence file from mosquitto 1.5 or earlier is loaded\n  * Limit auto_id_prefix to 50 characters\n\n- Update to version 2.0.22\n  Broker\n  * Bridge: Fix idle_timeout never occurring for lazy bridges.\n  * Fix case where max_queued_messages = 0 was not treated as\n    unlimited.\n  * Fix --version exit code and output.\n  * Fix crash on receiving a $CONTROL message over a bridge, if\n    per_listener_settings is set true and the bridge is carrying\n    out topic remapping.\n  * Fix incorrect reference clock being selected on startup on\n    Linux. Closes #3238.\n  * Fix reporting of client disconnections being incorrectly\n    attributed to \"out of memory\".\n  * Fix compilation when using WITH_OLD_KEEPALIVE.\n  * Fix problems with secure websockets.\n  * Fix crash on exit when using WITH_EPOLL=no.\n  * Fix clients being incorrectly expired when they have\n    keepalive == max_keepalive. Closes #3226, #3286.\n  Dynamic security plugin\n  * Fix mismatch memory free when saving config which caused\n    memory tracking to be incorrect.\n  Client library\n  * Fix C++ symbols being removed when compiled with link time\n    optimisation.\n  * TLS error handling was incorrectly setting a protocol error\n    for non-TLS errors. This would cause the mosquitto_loop_start()\n    thread to exit if no broker was available on the first\n    connection attempt. This has been fixed. Closes #3258.\n  * Fix linker errors on some architectures using cmake.\n\n- Update to version 2.0.21\n  Broker\n  * Fix clients sending a RESERVED packet not being quickly\n    disconnected.\n  * Fix bind_interface producing an error when used with an\n    interface that has an IPv6 link-local address and no other\n    IPv6 addresses.\n  * Fix mismatched wrapped/unwrapped memory alloc/free in\n    properties.\n  * Fix allow_anonymous false not being applied in local only mode.\n  * Add retain_expiry_interval option to fix expired retained\n    message not being removed from memory if they are not\n    subscribed to.\n  * Produce an error if invalid combinations of\n    cafile/capath/certfile/keyfile are used.\n  * Backport keepalive checking from develop to fix problems in\n    current implementation.\n  Client library\n  * Fix potential deadlock in mosquitto_sub if -W is used.\n  Apps\n  * mosquitto_ctrl dynsec now also allows -i to specify a clientid\n    as well as -c. This matches the documentation which states -i.\n  Tests\n  * Fix 08-ssl-connect-cert-auth-expired and\n    08-ssl-connect-cert-auth-revoked tests when under load.\n\n- systemd service: Wait till the network got setup to avoid\n  startup failure.\n",
