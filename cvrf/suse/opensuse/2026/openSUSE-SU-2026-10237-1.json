The buffer overflow may also potentially enable\ncode execution depending on platform mitigations.\n\nWhen verifying a PKCS#12 file that uses PBMAC1 for the MAC, the PBKDF2\nsalt and keylength parameters from the file are used without validation.\nIf the value of keylength exceeds the size of the fixed stack buffer used\nfor the derived key (64 bytes), the key derivation will overflow the buffer.\nThe overflow length is attacker-controlled. Also, if the salt parameter is\nnot an OCTET STRING type this can lead to invalid or NULL pointer\ndereference.\n\nExploiting this issue requires a user or application to process\na maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept untrusted\nPKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store private\nkeys which are trusted by definition. For this reason the issue was assessed\nas Moderate severity.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5 and 3.4 are not affected by this issue, as\nPKCS#12 processing is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5 and 3.4 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue as they do\nnot support PBMAC1 in PKCS#12.",

UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative\nvalue is added to the output length without validation, causing the\nlength to become negative.

      "Description": "Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote\nrecovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit\nARM platforms.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit\nARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..\n\nWhile remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,\ntiming measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.\n\nOpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so\nthis CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it is\npossible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled\nwith the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be\nrecoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate\nseverity issue.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.",
