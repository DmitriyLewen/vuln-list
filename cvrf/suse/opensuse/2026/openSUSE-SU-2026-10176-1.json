A malicious server could prepare a `RDPGFX_RESET_GRAPHICS_PDU` to allocate too small buffers, possibly triggering later out of bound read/write.

      "Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0, a client-side heap buffer overflow occurs in the ClearCodec bands decode path when crafted band coordinates allow writes past the end of the destination surface buffer. A malicious server can trigger a client-side heap buffer overflow, causing a crash (DoS) and potential heap corruption with code-execution risk depending on allocator behavior and surrounding heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.",
