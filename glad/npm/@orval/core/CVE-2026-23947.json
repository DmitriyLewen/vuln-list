  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23947",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@orval/core",
  "Title": "Orval has a code injection via unsanitized x-enum-descriptions in enum generation",
  "Description": "Arbitrary code execution in environments consuming generated clients\n\nThis issue is similar in nature to the recently-patched MCP vulnerability (CVE-2026-22785), but affects a different code path in @orval/core that was not addressed by that fix.\n\nThe vulnerability allows untrusted OpenAPI specifications to inject arbitrary TypeScript/JavaScript code into generated clients via the x-enumDescriptions field, which is embedded without proper escaping in getEnumImplementation(). I have confirmed that the injection occurs during const enum generation and results in executable code within the generated schema files.",
