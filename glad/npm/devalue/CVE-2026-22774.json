  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22774",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/devalue",
  "Title": "Devalue is vulnerable to denial of service due to memory exhaustion in devalue.parse",
  "Description": "Certain inputs can cause `devalue.parse` to consume excessive CPU time and/or memory, potentially leading to denial of service in systems that parse input from untrusted sources. This affects applications using `devalue.parse` on externally-supplied data. The root cause is the typed array hydration expecting an `ArrayBuffer` as input, but not checking the assumption before creating the typed array.",
