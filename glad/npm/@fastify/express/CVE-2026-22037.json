  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22037",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@fastify/express",
  "Title": "@fastify/express vulnerable to Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding)",
  "Description": "A security vulnerability exists in `@fastify/express` where middleware registered with a specific path prefix can be bypassed using URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/%61dmin` instead of `/admin`). While the middleware engine fails to match the encoded path and skips execution, the underlying Fastify router correctly decodes the path and matches the route handler, allowing attackers to access protected endpoints without the middleware constraints.",
