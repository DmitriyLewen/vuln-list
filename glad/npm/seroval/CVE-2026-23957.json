  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23957",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/seroval",
  "Title": "Seroval affected by Denial of Service via Array serialization",
  "Description": "Overriding encoded array lengths by replacing them with an excessively large value causes the deserialization process to **significantly increase processing time**.\n\n**Mitigation**:\n`Seroval` no longer encodes array lengths.\nInstead, it computes length using `Array.prototype.length` during deserialization.",
