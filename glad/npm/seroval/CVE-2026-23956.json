  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23956",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/seroval",
  "Title": "seroval affected by Denial of Service via RegExp serialization",
  "Description": "Overriding RegExp serialization with extremely large patterns can **exhaust JavaScript runtime memory** during deserialization. Additionally, overriding RegExp serialization with patterns that trigger **catastrophic backtracking** can lead to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).\n\n**Mitigation**:\n`Seroval` introduces `disabledFeatures` (a bitmask) in serialization/deserialization methods, with `Feature.RegExp` as a dedicated flag. **Users are recommended to configure `disabledFeatures` to disable RegExp serialization entirely.**",
