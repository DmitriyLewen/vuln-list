  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-15284",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/qs",
  "Title": "qs's arrayLimit bypass in its bracket notation allows DoS via memory exhaustion",
  "Description": "The `arrayLimit` option in qs did not enforce limits for bracket notation (`a[]=1\u0026a[]=2`), only for indexed notation (`a[0]=1`). This is a consistency bug; `arrayLimit` should apply uniformly across all array notations.\n\n**Note:** The default `parameterLimit` of 1000 effectively mitigates the DoS scenario originally described. With default options, bracket notation cannot produce arrays larger than `parameterLimit` regardless of `arrayLimit`, because each `a[]=value` consumes one parameter slot. The severity has been reduced accordingly.",
