  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24769",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/nocodb",
  "Title": "NocoDB Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG upload",

Authenticated users can upload malicious SVG files containing embedded JavaScript, which are later rendered inline and executed in the browsers of other users who view the attachment.\n\nBecause the malicious payload is stored server-side and executed under the application’s origin, successful exploitation can lead to account compromise, data exfiltration and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of affected users.\n\n---",
