  "Title": "NocoDB has Blind SSRF via Unvalidated HEAD Request in uploadViaURL Functionality",
  "Description": "A **blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability exists in the `uploadViaURL` functionality due to an unprotected `HEAD` request. While the subsequent file retrieval logic correctly enforces SSRF protections, the initial metadata request executes without validation.\n\nThis allows limited outbound requests to arbitrary URLs before SSRF controls are applied.\n\n---",
