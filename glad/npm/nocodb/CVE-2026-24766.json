  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24766",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/nocodb",
  "Title": "NocoDB has Prototype Pollution in Connection Test Endpoint, Leading to DoS",
  "Description": "An authenticated user with org-level-creator permissions can exploit prototype pollution in the `/api/v2/meta/connection/test` endpoint, causing all database write operations to fail application-wide until server restart.\n\nWhile the pollution technically bypasses SUPER_ADMIN authorization checks, no practical privileged actions can be performed because database operations fail immediately after pollution.",
