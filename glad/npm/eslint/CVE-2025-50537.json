  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-50537",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/eslint",
  "Title": "Withdrawn Advisory: eslint has a Stack Overflow when serializing objects with circular references",
  "Description": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because RuleTester is used for testing rules during development and results in a error rather than crashing the application.\n\n## Original Description\n\nThere is a Stack Overflow vulnerability in eslint before 9.26.0 when serializing objects with circular references in `eslint/lib/shared/serialization.js`. The exploit is triggered via the `RuleTester.run()` method, which validates test cases and checks for duplicates. During validation, the internal function `checkDuplicateTestCase()` is called, which in turn uses the `isSerializable()` function for serialization checks. When a circular reference object is passed in, `isSerializable()` enters infinite recursion, ultimately causing a Stack Overflow.",
