  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22686",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/enclave-vm",
  "Title": "enclave-vm Vulnerable to Sandbox Escape via Host Error Prototype Chain",
  "Description": "A critical sandbox escape vulnerability exists in **enclave-vm** (affected: **\u003c 2.6.0**, patched: **2.7.0**) that can allow untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript to execute arbitrary code in the **host Node.js runtime**.\n\nWhen a tool invocation fails, enclave-vm exposes a **host-side Error object** to sandboxed code. This Error object retains its **host realm prototype chain**, which can be traversed to reach the **host `Function` constructor**:\n\n`Error instance → Error.prototype → Error constructor → Function constructor`\n\nWith access to the host `Function` constructor, an attacker can compile and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the host context — bypassing the sandbox boundary and potentially gaining access to sensitive resources such as `process.env`, filesystem, and network.\n\nThis breaks enclave-vm’s core security guarantee of isolating untrusted code.\n\n---",
