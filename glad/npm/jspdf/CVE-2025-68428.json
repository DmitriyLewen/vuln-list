  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68428",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/jspdf",
  "Title": "jsPDF has Local File Inclusion/Path Traversal vulnerability",
  "Description": "User control of the first argument of the loadFile method in the node.js build allows local file inclusion/path traversal.\n\nIf given the possibility to pass unsanitized paths to the loadFile method, a user can retrieve file contents of arbitrary files in the local file system the node process is running in. The file contents are included verbatim in the generated PDFs.\n\nOther affected methods are: `addImage`, `html`, `addFont`.\n\nOnly the node.js builds of the library are affected, namely the `dist/jspdf.node.js` and `dist/jspdf.node.min.js` files.\n\nExample attack vector:\n\n```js\nimport { jsPDF } from \"./dist/jspdf.node.js\";\n\nconst doc = new jsPDF();\n\ndoc.addImage(\"./secret.txt\", \"JPEG\", 0, 0, 10, 10);\ndoc.save(\"test.pdf\"); // the generated PDF will contain the \"secret.txt\" file\n```",
