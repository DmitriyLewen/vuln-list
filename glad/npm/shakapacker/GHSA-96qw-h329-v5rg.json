  "Title": "Shakapacker has environment variable leak via EnvironmentPlugin that exposes secrets to client-side bundles",
  "Description": "Since 2017, the default webpack plugins have passed the entire `process.env` to `EnvironmentPlugin`. This pattern exposed ALL build environment variables to client-side JavaScript bundles whenever application code (or any dependency) referenced `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.\n\nThis is not a regression - the vulnerable code has existed since the original Webpacker implementation. No recent code change in Shakapacker triggered this issue.",
