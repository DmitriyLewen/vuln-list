  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66398",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/signalk-server",
  "Title": "Signal K Server has Unauthenticated State Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
  "Description": "An unauthenticated attacker can pollute the internal state (`restoreFilePath`) of the server via the `/skServer/validateBackup` endpoint. This allows the attacker to hijack the administrator's \"Restore\" functionality to overwrite critical server configuration files (e.g., `security.json`, `package.json`), leading to account takeover and Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
