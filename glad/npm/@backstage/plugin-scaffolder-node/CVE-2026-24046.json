  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24046",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node",
  "Title": "Backstage has a Possible Symlink Path Traversal in Scaffolder Actions",
  "Description": "Multiple Scaffolder actions and archive extraction utilities were vulnerable to symlink-based path traversal attacks. An attacker with access to create and execute Scaffolder templates could exploit symlinks to:\n\n1. **Read arbitrary files** via the `debug:log` action by creating a symlink pointing to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, secrets)\n2. **Delete arbitrary files** via the `fs:delete` action by creating symlinks pointing outside the workspace\n3. **Write files outside the workspace** via archive extraction (tar/zip) containing malicious symlinks\n\nThis affects any Backstage deployment where users can create or execute Scaffolder templates.",
