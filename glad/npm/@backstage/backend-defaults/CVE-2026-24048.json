  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24048",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@backstage/backend-defaults",
  "Title": "Backstage has a Possible SSRF when reading from allowed URL's in `backend.reading.allow`",
  "Description": "The `FetchUrlReader` component, used by the catalog and other plugins to fetch content from URLs, followed HTTP redirects automatically. This allowed an attacker who controls a host listed in `backend.reading.allow` to redirect requests to internal or sensitive URLs that are not on the allowlist, bypassing the URL allowlist security control.\n\nThis is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could allow access to internal resources, but it does not allow attackers to include additional request headers.",
