  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68949",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/n8n",
  "Title": "n8n: Webhook Node IP `Whitelist` Bypass via Partial String Matching",
  "Description": "The Webhook node’s IP `whitelist` validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured `whitelist` entry as a substring.\n\nThis issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-`whitelist`ed IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary.",
