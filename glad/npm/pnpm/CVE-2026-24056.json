  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24056",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/pnpm",
  "Title": "pnpm has symlink traversal in file:/git dependencies",
  "Description": "When pnpm installs a `file:` (directory) or `git:` dependency, it follows symlinks and reads their target contents without constraining them to the package root. A malicious package containing a symlink to an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) causes pnpm to copy that file's contents into `node_modules`, leaking local data.\n\n**Preconditions:** Only affects `file:` and `git:` dependencies. Registry packages (npm) have symlinks stripped during publish and are NOT affected.",
