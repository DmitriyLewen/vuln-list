  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23888",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/pnpm",
  "Title": "pnpm: Binary ZIP extraction allows arbitrary file write via path traversal (Zip Slip)",
  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's binary fetcher allows malicious packages to write files outside the intended extraction directory. The vulnerability has two attack vectors: (1) Malicious ZIP entries containing `../` or absolute paths that escape the extraction root via AdmZip's `extractAllTo`, and (2) The `BinaryResolution.prefix` field is concatenated into the extraction path without validation, allowing a crafted prefix like `../../evil` to redirect extracted files outside `targetDir`.",
