  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-69264",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/pnpm",
  "Title": "pnpm v10+ Bypass \"Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default\"",
  "Description": "A security bypass vulnerability in pnpm v10+ allows git-hosted dependencies to execute arbitrary code during `pnpm install`, circumventing the v10 security feature \"Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default\". While pnpm v10 blocks `postinstall` scripts via the `onlyBuiltDependencies` mechanism, git dependencies can still execute `prepare`, `prepublish`, and `prepack` scripts during the fetch phase, enabling remote code execution without user consent or approval.",
