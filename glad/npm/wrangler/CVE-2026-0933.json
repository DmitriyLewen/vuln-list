  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-0933",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/wrangler",
  "Title": "Wrangler affected by OS Command Injection in `wrangler pages deploy`",
  "Description": "**Summary**\n\nA command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.\n\n**Root cause**\n\nThe `commitHash` variable, derived from user input via the `--commit-hash` CLI argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g., ``execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)``). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit, as it requires `--commit-hash` to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the `--commit-hash` parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources. An attacker could exploit this to:\n\n- Run any shell command.\n- Exfiltrate environment variables.\n- Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\n- Wrangler v4 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.\n- Wrangler v3 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.\n- Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade to a supported major version.\n\n**Credits**\n\nDisclosed responsibly by kny4hacker.",
