  "Title": "Duplicate Advisory: Remote code execution in dask",
  "Description": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-hwqr-f3v9-hwxr. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nAn issue was discovered in Dask (aka python-dask) through 2021.09.1. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.",
