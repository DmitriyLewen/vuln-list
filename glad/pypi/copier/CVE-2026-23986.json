  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23986",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/copier",
  "Title": "Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem write access via directory symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: true ",
  "Description": "Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe) features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary directories outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with [`_preserve_symlinks: true`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#preserve_symlinks) and a [generated directory structure](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#generating-a-directory-structure) whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e\n\u003e At the time of writing, the exploit is non-deterministic, as Copier walks the template's file tree using [`os.scandir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) which yields directory entries in arbitrary order.\n\nReproducible example (may or may not work depending on directory entry yield order):\n\n```shell\nmkdir other/\npushd other/\necho \"sensitive\" \u003e sensitive.txt\npopd\n\nmkdir src/\npushd src/\nln -s ../other other\necho \"overwritten\" \u003e \"{{ pathjoin('other', 'sensitive.txt') }}.jinja\"\necho \"_preserve_symlinks: true\" \u003e copier.yml\ntree .",
