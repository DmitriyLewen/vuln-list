  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23968",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/copier",
  "Title": "Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read access via symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: false",
  "Description": "Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe) features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently include arbitrary files/directories outside the local template clone location by using symlinks along with [`_preserve_symlinks: false`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#preserve_symlinks) (which is Copier's default setting).\n\nImagine, e.g., a malicious template author who creates a template that reads SSH keys or other secrets from well-known locations and hopes for a user to push the generated project to a public location like [github.com](https://github.com/) where the template author can extract the secrets.\n\nReproducible example:\n\n- Illegally include a file in the generated project via symlink resolution:\n\n```shell\necho \"s3cr3t\" \u003e secret.txt\n\nmkdir src/\npushd src/\nln -s ../secret.txt stolen-secret.txt\npopd\n\nuvx copier copy src/ dst/\n\ncat dst/stolen-secret.txt",
