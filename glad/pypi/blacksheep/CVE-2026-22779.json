  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22779",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/blacksheep",
  "Title": "BlackSheep's ClientSession is vulnerable to CRLF injection",
  "Description": "The HTTP Client implementation in BlackSheep is vulnerable to CRLF injection. Missing headers validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP requests (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request.\nExploitation requires developers to pass unsanitized user input directly into headers.\nThe server part is not affected because BlackSheep delegates to an underlying ASGI server handling of response headers.\n\n**Attack vector:** Applications using user input in HTTP client requests (method, URL, headers).",
