  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-21871",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/nicegui",
  "Title": "NiceGUI is vulnerable to XSS via Unescaped URL in ui.navigate.history.push() / replace()",
  "Description": "XSS risk exists in NiceGUI when developers pass attacker-controlled strings into `ui.navigate.history.push()` or `ui.navigate.history.replace()`. These helpers are documented as History API wrappers for updating the browser URL without page reload. However, if the URL argument is embedded into generated JavaScript without proper escaping, a crafted payload can break out of the intended string context and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser.\n\n**Applications that do not pass untrusted input into `ui.navigate.history.push/replace` are not affected.**",
