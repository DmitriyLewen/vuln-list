  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22607",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fickling",
  "Title": "Fickling Blocklist Bypass: cProfile.run()",
  "Description": "Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python's `cProfile` module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses `cProfile.run()` is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS.\n\nIf a user relies on Fickling's output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system.\n\nThis affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization.",
