  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22606",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fickling",
  "Title": "Fickling has a bypass via runpy.run_path() and runpy.run_module()",
  "Description": "Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python’s runpy module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses runpy.run_path() or runpy.run_module() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS.\n\nIf a user relies on Fickling’s output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system.\n\nThis affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization.",
