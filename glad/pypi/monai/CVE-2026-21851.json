  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-21851",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/monai",
  "Title": "MONAI has Path Traversal (Zip Slip) in NGC Private Bundle Download",
  "Description": "A **Path Traversal (Zip Slip)** vulnerability exists in MONAI's `_download_from_ngc_private()` function. The function uses `zipfile.ZipFile.extractall()` without path validation, while other similar download functions in the same codebase properly use the existing `safe_extract_member()` function.\n\nThis appears to be an implementation oversight, as safe extraction is already implemented and used elsewhere in MONAI.\n\n**CWE:** CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)\n\n---",
