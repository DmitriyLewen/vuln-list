  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-0994",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/protobuf",
  "Title": "protobuf affected by a JSON recursion depth bypass",
  "Description": "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in google.protobuf.json_format.ParseDict() in Python, where the max_recursion_depth limit can be bypassed when parsing nested google.protobuf.Any messages.\n\nDue to missing recursion depth accounting inside the internal Any-handling logic, an attacker can supply deeply nested Any structures that bypass the intended recursion limit, eventually exhausting Python’s recursion stack and causing a RecursionError.",
