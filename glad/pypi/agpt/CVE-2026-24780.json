  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24780",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/agpt",
  "Title": "AutoGPT is Vulnerable to RCE via Disabled Block Execution",
  "Description": "AutoGPT Platform's block execution endpoints (both main web API and external API) allow executing blocks by UUID without checking the `disabled` flag. Any authenticated user can execute the disabled `BlockInstallationBlock`, which writes arbitrary Python code to the server filesystem and executes it via `__import__()`, achieving Remote Code Execution. In default self-hosted deployments where Supabase signup is enabled, an attacker can self-register; if signup is disabled (e.g., hosted), the attacker needs an existing account.",
