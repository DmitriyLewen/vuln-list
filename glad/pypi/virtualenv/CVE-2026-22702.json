  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22702",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/virtualenv",
  "Title": "virtualenv Has TOCTOU Vulnerabilities in Directory Creation",
  "Description": "TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities in `virtualenv` allow local attackers to perform symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with local access can exploit a race condition between directory existence checks and creation to redirect virtualenv's app_data and lock file operations to attacker-controlled locations.\n\n**Affected versions:** All versions up to and including 20.36.1\n\n**Affected users:** Any user running `virtualenv` on multi-user systems where untrusted local users have filesystem access to shared temporary directories or where `VIRTUALENV_OVERRIDE_APP_DATA` points to a user-writable location.\n\n**Attack scenarios:**\n- Cache poisoning: Attacker corrupts wheels or Python metadata in the cache\n- Information disclosure: Attacker reads sensitive cached data or metadata\n- Lock bypass: Attacker controls lock file semantics to cause concurrent access violations\n- Denial of service: Lock starvation preventing virtualenv operations",
