  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68616",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/weasyprint",
  "Title": "WeasyPrint has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Protection Bypass via HTTP Redirect",
  "Description": "A **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Protection Bypass** exists in WeasyPrint's `default_url_fetcher`. The vulnerability allows attackers to access internal network resources (such as `localhost` services or cloud metadata endpoints) even when a developer has implemented a custom `url_fetcher` to block such access. This occurs because the underlying `urllib` library follows HTTP redirects automatically without re-validating the new destination against the developer's security policy.",
