  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24739",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/symfony/symfony",
  "Title": "Symfony's incorrect argument escaping under MSYS2/Git Bash can lead to destructive file operations on Windows",
  "Description": "The Symfony Process component did not correctly treat some characters (notably `=`) as “special” when escaping arguments on Windows. When PHP is executed from an MSYS2-based environment (e.g. Git Bash) and Symfony Process spawns native Windows executables, MSYS2’s argument/path conversion can mishandle unquoted arguments containing these characters.\n\nThis can cause the spawned process to receive corrupted/truncated arguments compared to what Symfony intended.",
