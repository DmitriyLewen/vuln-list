  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23622",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/alextselegidis/easyappointments",
  "Title": "alextselegidis/easyappointments is Vulnerable to CSRF Protection Bypass",
  "Description": "`application/core/EA_Security.php::csrf_verify()` only enforces CSRF for POST requests and returns early for non-POST methods. Several application endpoints perform state-changing operations while accepting parameters from GET (or $_REQUEST), so an attacker can perform CSRF by forcing a victim's browser to issue a crafted GET request. Impact: creation of admin accounts, modification of admin email/password, and full admin account takeover",
