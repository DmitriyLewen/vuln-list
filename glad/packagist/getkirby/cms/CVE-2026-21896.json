  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-21896",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/getkirby/cms",
  "Title": "Kirby is missing permission checks in the content changes API",
  "Description": "The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to create or discard a changes version or update the content fields in an existing changes version. All of these actions could affect arbitrary models.\n\nThis could cause the following impact:\n\n- Attackers could maliciously create changes versions for all models of the site, creating editing locks that would prevent other authenticated users from making content changes until those locks were cleared.\n- Attackers could update the content in a malicious way, for example by adding defamatory or spam content or by including malicious links or scripts. While this updated content would not immediately be published to the site, an inattentive editor with update permissions could inadvertently publish these changes in the belief that an authorized user has made them.\n- Attackers could discard extensive changes, making editors lose their content work.",
