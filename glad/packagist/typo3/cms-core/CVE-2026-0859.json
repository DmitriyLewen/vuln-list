  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-0859",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/typo3/cms-core",
  "Title": "TYPO3 CMS Allows Insecure Deserialization via Mailer File Spool",
  "Description": "### Problem\nLocal platform users who can write to TYPO3’s mail‑file spool directory can craft a file that the system will automatically deserialize without any class restrictions. This flaw allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code in the public scope of the web server.\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered when TYPO3 is configured with `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['transport_spool_type'] = 'file';` and a scheduler task or cron job runs the command `mailer:spool:send`. The spool‑send operation performs the insecure deserialization that is at the core of this issue.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS, 12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23 LTS, 14.0.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Vitaly Simonovich for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 security team members Elias Häußler and Oliver Hader for fixing it.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-004](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-004)",
