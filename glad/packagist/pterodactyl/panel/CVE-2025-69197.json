  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-69197",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pterodactyl/panel",
  "Title": "Pterodactyl TOTPs can be reused during validity window",
  "Description": "When a user signs into an account with 2FA enabled they are prompted to enter a token. When that token is used, it is not sufficiently marked as used in the system allowing an attacker that intercepts that token to then use it in addition to a known username/password during the token validity window.\n\nThis vulnerability requires that an attacker already be in possession of a valid username and password combination, and intercept a valid 2FA token (for example, during a screen share). The token must then be provided in addition to the username and password during the limited token validity window. The validity window is ~60 seconds as the Panel allows at most one additional window to the current one, each window being 30 seconds.",
