  "PackageSlug": "packagist/egroupware/egroupware",
  "Title": "EGroupware has SQL Injection in Nextmatch Filter Processing",
  "Description": "**Critical Authenticated SQL Injection in Nextmatch Widget Filter Processing**\n\nA critical SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the core components of EGroupware, specifically in the `Nextmatch` filter processing. The flaw allows authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the `WHERE` clause of database queries. This is achieved by exploiting a PHP type juggling issue where JSON decoding converts numeric strings into integers, bypassing the `is_int()` security check used by the application.",
