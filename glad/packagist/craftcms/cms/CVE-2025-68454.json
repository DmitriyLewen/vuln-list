  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68454",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/craftcms/cms",
  "Title": "Craft CMS vulnerable to potential authenticated Remote Code Execution via Twig SSTI",
  "Description": "For this to work, users must have administrator access to the Craft Control Panel, and [allowAdminChanges](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#allowadminchanges) must be enabled for this to work, which is against Craft CMS' recommendations for any non-dev environment.\n\nhttps://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/securing-craft#set-allowAdminChanges-to-false-in-production\n\nAlternatively, a non-administrator account with allowAdminChanges disabled can be used, provided access to the System Messages utility is available.\n\nIt is possible to craft a malicious payload using the Twig `map` filter in text fields that accept Twig input under Settings in the Craft control panel or using the System Messages utility, which could lead to a RCE.\n\nUsers should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/d82680f4a05f9576883bb83c3f6243d33ca73ebe\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/5.x/CHANGELOG.md#5821---2025-12-04",
