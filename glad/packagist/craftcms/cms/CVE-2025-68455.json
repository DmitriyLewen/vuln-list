  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68455",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/craftcms/cms",
  "Title": "Craft CMS vulnerable to potential authenticated Remote Code Execution via malicious attached Behavior",
  "Description": "This was reported as a vulnerability in Yii framework on August 7th (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4). The Yii framework team denies responsibility for this (placing the onus on application developers) and hence has not (and seemingly will not) provide a fix at the framework level. Hence, I am reporting this to Craft as I found it to affect the latest (`5.6.0`) version of Craft CMS.\n\nLeveraging a legitimate but maliciously crafted Yii `Behavior` class, it’s possible to trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Reflection when the tainted `Behavior` is attached to a Yii `Component`, and an event is also fired on the tainted `Component`.",
