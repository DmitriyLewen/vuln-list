  "Title": "Freeform Craft Plugin CP UI (builder/integrations) has Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue",
  "Description": "**Summary**\nAn authenticated, low-privilege user (able to create/edit forms) can inject arbitrary HTML/JS into the Craft Control Panel (CP) builder and integrations views. User-controlled form labels and integration metadata are rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization, leading to stored XSS that executes when any admin views the builder/integration screens.\n\n**Affected Product**\n- Ecosystem: Packagist (Craft CMS plugin)\n- Package: solspace/craft-freeform\n- Version: \u003c= 5.14.6 (latest observed). Likely all 5.x until patched.",
