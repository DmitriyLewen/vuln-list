  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23494",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pimcore/pimcore",
  "Title": "Pimcore is Vulnerable to Broken Access Control: Missing Function Level Authorization on \"Static Routes\" Listing",
  "Description": "The application fails to enforce proper server-side authorization checks on the API endpoint responsible for reading or listing static routes. In Pimcore, static routes are custom URL patterns defined via the backend interface or the var/config/staticroutes.php file, including details like regex-based patterns, controllers, variables, and priorities. These routes are registered automatically through the PimcoreStaticRoutesBundle and integrated into the MVC routing system. Testing revealed that an authenticated backend user lacking explicit permissions was able to invoke the endpoint (e.g., GET /api/static-routes) and retrieve sensitive route configurations. This violates OWASP A01:2021 Broken Access Control, as function-level authorization is absent, allowing unauthorized access to internal routing metadata. Without validation, the endpoint exposes route structures, potentially revealing application architecture, endpoints, or custom logic intended for administrative roles only.",
