  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pimcore/pimcore",
  "Title": "Pimcore Has an Incomplete Patch for CVE-2023-30848",
  "Description": "An **incomplete SQL injection patch** in the Admin Search Find API allows an authenticated attacker to perform **blind SQL injection**.\nAlthough CVE-2023-30848 attempted to mitigate SQL injection by removing SQL comments (--) and catching syntax errors, the fix is insufficient. Attackers can still inject SQL payloads that do not rely on comments and infer database information via blind techniques. This vulnerability affects the admin interface and can lead to **database information disclosure**.",
