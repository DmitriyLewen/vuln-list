  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-21451",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/bagisto/bagisto",
  "Title": "Bagisto has HTML Filter Bypass that Enables Stored XSS",
  "Description": "A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto 2.3.8 within the CMS page editor. Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize `\u003cscript\u003e` tags, the filtering can be bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST request before submission. As a result, arbitrary JavaScript can be stored in the CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited.\nThis exposes administrators to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover, backend hijacking, and malicious script execution.",
