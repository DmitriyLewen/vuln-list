  "Title": "Soft Serve Affected by an Authentication Bypass",
  "Description": "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis issue impacts every Soft Serve instance.\n\nA critical authentication bypass allows an attacker to impersonate any user (including Admin) by \"offering\" the victim's public key during the SSH handshake before authenticating with their own valid key. This occurs because the user identity is stored in the session context during the \"offer\" phase and is not cleared if that specific authentication attempt fails.",
