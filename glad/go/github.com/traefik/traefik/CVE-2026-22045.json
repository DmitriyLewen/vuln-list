  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22045",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/traefik/traefik",
  "Title": "Traefik's ACME TLS-ALPN fast path lacks timeouts and close on handshake stall",
  "Description": "- Affected code: `pkg/server/router/tcp/router.go` (ACME TLS-ALPN handling).\n- When a ClientHello advertises `acme-tls/1`, Traefik intercepts it and calls `tls.Server(...).Handshake()` without any read/write deadlines and without closing the connection afterward.\n- Immediately before this branch, existing deadlines set by the entrypoint are cleared.\n- A client that sends the ALPN marker and then stops responding can keep the goroutine and socket open indefinitely, potentially exhausting the entrypoint under load.\n- Exposure is limited to entrypoints where the ACME TLS-ALPN challenge is enabled and ACME bypass is not allowed.",
