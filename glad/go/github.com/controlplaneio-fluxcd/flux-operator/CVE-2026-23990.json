  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23990",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator",
  "Title": "Flux Operator Web UI Impersonation Bypass via Empty OIDC Claims",
  "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Flux Operator Web UI authentication code that allows an attacker to bypass Kubernetes RBAC impersonation and execute API requests with the operator's service account privileges.\n\nAfter OIDC token claims are processed through CEL expressions, there is no validation that the resulting `username` and `groups` values are non-empty. When both values are empty, the Kubernetes client-go library does not add impersonation headers to API requests, causing them to be executed with the flux-operator service account's credentials instead of the authenticated user's limited permissions.",
