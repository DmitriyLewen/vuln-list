  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-22772",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/sigstore/fulcio",
  "Title": "Fulcio is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via MetaIssuer Regex Bypass",
  "Description": "Fulcio's `metaRegex()` function uses unanchored regex, allowing attackers to bypass MetaIssuer URL validation and trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal services.\n\nSince the SSRF only can trigger GET requests, the request cannot mutate state. The response from the GET request is not returned to the caller so data exfiltration is not possible. A malicious actor could attempt to probe an internal network through [Blind SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind).",
