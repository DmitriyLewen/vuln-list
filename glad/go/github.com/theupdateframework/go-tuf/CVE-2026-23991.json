  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf",
  "Title": "go-tuf affected by client DoS via malformed server response",
  "Description": "If the TUF repository (or any of its mirrors) returns invalid TUF metadata JSON (valid JSON but not well formed TUF metadata), the client will panic _during parsing_, causing a DoS. The panic happens before any signature is validated. This means that a compromised repository/mirror/cache can DoS clients without having access to any signing key.",
