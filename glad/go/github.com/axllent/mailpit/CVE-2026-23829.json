  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23829",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/axllent/mailpit",
  "Title": "Mailpit has an SMTP Header Injection via Regex Bypass",
  "Description": "Mailpit's SMTP server is vulnerable to **Header Injection** due to an insufficient Regular Expression used to validate `RCPT TO` and `MAIL FROM` addresses. An attacker can inject arbitrary SMTP headers (or corrupt existing ones) by including carriage return characters (`\\r`) in the email address. This header injection occurs because the regex intended to filter control characters fails to exclude `\\r` and `\\n` when used inside a character class.",
