{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-24845",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent",
  "Title": "malcontent OCI image pull credential exfiltration via malicious registry token realm",
  "Description": "Malcontent could be made to expose Docker registry credentials if it scanned a specially crafted OCI image reference. Malcontent uses [google/go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry) for OCI image pulls, which by default uses the Docker credential keychain. A malicious registry could return a `WWW-Authenticate` header redirecting token authentication to an attacker-controlled endpoint, causing credentials to be sent to that endpoint.\n\n**Fix:** [Default to anonymous auth for OCI pulls](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/commit/538ed00cdc639d687a4bd1e843a2be0428a3b3e7)\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThank you to Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.",
