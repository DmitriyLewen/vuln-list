  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/juju/juju",
  "Title": "Juju has broken CMR authorization",
  "Description": "Cross-model Relation authorization is broken and has a potential security vulnerability. If the controller does not have the root key to verify the macaroon (or if the macaroon has expired), an unvalidated and therefore untrusted macaroon is used to extract declared caveats. Facts from these caveats are then blindly used to mint a new macaroon that becomes valid.",
