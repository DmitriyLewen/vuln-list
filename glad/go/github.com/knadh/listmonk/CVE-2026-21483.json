  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-21483",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/knadh/listmonk",
  "Title": "listmonk Vulnerable to Stored XSS Leading to Admin Account Takeover",
  "Description": "A lower-privileged user with campaign management permissions can inject malicious JavaScript into campaigns or templates. When a higher-privileged user (Super Admin) views or previews this content, the XSS executes in their browser context, allowing the attacker to perform privileged actions such as creating backdoor admin accounts.\n\nThe attack can be weaponized via the **public archive feature**, where victims simply need to visit a link - no preview click required.\n\n---",
