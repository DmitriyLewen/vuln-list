  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/lxc/incus",
  "Title": "Incus container image templating arbitrary host file read and write",
  "Description": "A user with the ability to launch a container with a custom image (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can use directory traversal or symbolic links in the templating functionality to achieve host arbitrary file read, and host arbitrary file write, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution on the host. This can also be exploited in IncusOS.",
