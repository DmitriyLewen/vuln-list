  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-23953",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/lxc/incus",
  "Title": "Incus container environment configuration newline injection",
  "Description": "A user with the ability to launch a container with a custom YAML configuration (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can create an environment variable containing newlines, which can be used to add additional configuration items in the container’s `lxc.conf` due to the newline injection. This can allow adding arbitrary lifecycle hooks, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution on the host.",
