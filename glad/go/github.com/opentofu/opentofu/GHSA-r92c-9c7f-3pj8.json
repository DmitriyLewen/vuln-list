  "Title": "OpenTofu has High CPU usage in \"tofu init\" with maliciously-crafted module packages in .zip format",
  "Description": "When installing module packages from attacker-controlled sources, `tofu init` may cause high CPU usage when encountering maliciously-crafted `.zip` archives for either provider or module distribution packages.\n\nThose who depend on modules or providers served from untrusted third-party servers may experience denial of service due to `tofu init` failing to complete in a timely manner. Other processes running on the same computer as OpenTofu may also have their performance degraded due to the high CPU usage.\n\nThese vulnerabilities **do not** permit arbitrary code execution or allow disclosure of confidential information.",
