  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-21885",
  "PackageSlug": "go/miniflux.app",
  "Title": "Miniflux Media Proxy SSRF via /proxy endpoint allows access to internal network resources",
  "Description": "Miniflux's media proxy endpoint (`GET /proxy/{encodedDigest}/{encodedURL}`) can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An authenticated user can cause Miniflux to generate a signed proxy URL for attacker-chosen media URLs embedded in feed entry content, including internal addresses (e.g., localhost, private RFC1918 ranges, or link-local metadata endpoints). Requesting the resulting `/proxy/...` URL makes Miniflux fetch and return the internal response.",
