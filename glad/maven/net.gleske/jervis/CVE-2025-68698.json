  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68698",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/net.gleske/jervis",
  "Title": "Jervis Has a RSA PKCS#1 Padding Vulnerability",
  "Description": "Severity is considered low for internal uses of this library but if there's any consumer using these methods directly then this is considered critical.\n\nAn attacker with access to a decryption oracle (e.g., timing differences or error messages) could potentially decrypt ciphertext without knowing the private key.\n\nJervis uses RSA to encrypt AES keys in local-only storage inaccessible from the web.  The data stored is GitHub App authentication tokens which will expire within one hour or less.",
