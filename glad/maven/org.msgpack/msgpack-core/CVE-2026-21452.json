  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.msgpack/msgpack-core",
  "Title": "MessagePack for Java Vulnerable to Remote DoS via Malicious EXT Payload Allocation",
  "Description": "Affected Components:\n```\norg.msgpack.core.MessageUnpacker.readPayload()\norg.msgpack.core.MessageUnpacker.unpackValue()\norg.msgpack.value.ExtensionValue.getData()\n```\nA denial-of-service vulnerability exists in MessagePack for Java when deserializing .msgpack files containing EXT32 objects with attacker-controlled payload lengths. While MessagePack-Java parses extension headers lazily, it later trusts the declared EXT payload length when materializing the extension data. When ExtensionValue.getData() is invoked, the library attempts to allocate a byte array of the declared length without enforcing any upper bound. A malicious .msgpack file of only a few bytes can therefore trigger unbounded heap allocation, resulting in JVM heap exhaustion, process termination, or service unavailability. This vulnerability is triggered during model loading / deserialization, making it a model format vulnerability suitable for remote exploitation.",
