  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-1190",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services",
  "Title": "Keycloak's missing timestamp validation allows attackers to extend SAML response validity periods",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak's SAML brokering functionality. When Keycloak is configured as a client in a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) setup, it fails to validate the `NotOnOrAfter` timestamp within the `SubjectConfirmationData`. This allows an attacker to delay the expiration of SAML responses, potentially extending the time a response is considered valid and leading to unexpected session durations or resource consumption.",
