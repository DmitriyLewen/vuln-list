  "Identifier": "CVE-2026-0976",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-server",
  "Title": "Keycloak has an improper input validation vulnerability",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. This improper input validation vulnerability occurs because Keycloak accepts RFC-compliant matrix parameters in URL path segments, while common reverse proxy configurations may ignore or mishandle them. A remote attacker can craft requests to mask path segments, potentially bypassing proxy-level path filtering. This could expose administrative or sensitive endpoints that operators believe are not externally reachable.",
