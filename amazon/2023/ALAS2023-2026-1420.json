  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2026-22703:\n\tCosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.4, Cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify an artifact even if the embedded Rekor entry does not reference the artifact's digest, signature or public key. When verifying a Rekor entry, Cosign verifies the Rekor entry signature, and also compares the artifact's digest, the user's public key from either a Fulcio certificate or provided by the user, and the artifact signature to the Rekor entry contents. Without these comparisons, Cosign would accept any response from Rekor as valid. A malicious actor that has compromised a user's identity or signing key could construct a valid Cosign bundle by including any arbitrary Rekor entry, thus preventing the user from being able to audit the signing event. This issue has been patched in versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.4.\n\nCVE-2025-68121:\n\tcrypto/tls: Config.Clone copies automatically generated session ticket keys, session resumption does not account for the expiration of full certificate chain\n\nCVE-2025-68119:\n\tcmd/go: unexpected code execution when invoking toolchain\n\nCVE-2025-61731:\n\tcmd/go: bypass of flag sanitization can lead to arbitrary code execution\n\nCVE-2025-61730:\n\tcrypto/tls: handshake messages may be processed at the incorrect encryption level\n\nCVE-2025-61728:\n\tarchive/zip: denial of service when parsing arbitrary ZIP archives\n\nCVE-2025-61726:\n\tnet/http: memory exhaustion in Request.ParseForm\n",
