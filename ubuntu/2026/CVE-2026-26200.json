  "Description": "HDF5 is software for managing data. Prior to version 1.14.4-2, an attacker who can control an `h5` file parsed by HDF5 can trigger a write-based heap buffer overflow condition. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, and potentially further issues such as remote code execution depending on the practical exploitability of the heap overflow against modern operating systems. Real-world exploitability of this issue in terms of remote-code execution is currently unknown. Version 1.14.4-2 fixes the issue.",
