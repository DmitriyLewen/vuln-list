  "Description": "A flaw was found in the FTP GVfs backend. A remote attacker could exploit this input validation vulnerability by supplying specially crafted file paths containing carriage return and line feed (CRLF) sequences. These unsanitized sequences allow the attacker to terminate intended FTP commands and inject arbitrary FTP commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other severe impacts.",
