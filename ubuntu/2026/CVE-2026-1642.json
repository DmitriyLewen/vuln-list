  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in NGINX OSS and NGINX Plus when configured to proxy to upstream Transport Layer Security (TLS) servers. An attacker with a man-in-the-middle (MITM) position on the upstream server side—along with conditions beyond the attacker's control—may be able to inject plain text data into the response from an upstream proxied server.  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.",
