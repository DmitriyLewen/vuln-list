  "Description": "A weakness has been identified in niklasso minisat up to 2.2.0. This issue affects the function Solver::value in the library core/SolverTypes.h of the component DIMACS File Parser. This manipulation of the argument variable index with the input 2147483648 causes out-of-bounds read. The attack needs to be launched locally. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",
