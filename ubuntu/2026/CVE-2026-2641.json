  "Description": "A weakness has been identified in universal-ctags ctags up to 6.2.1. The affected element is the function parseExpression/parseExprList of the file parsers/v.c of the component V Language Parser. Executing a manipulation can lead to uncontrolled recursion. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be used for attacks. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",
