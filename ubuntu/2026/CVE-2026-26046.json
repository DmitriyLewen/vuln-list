  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in a Moodle TeX filter administrative setting where insufficient sanitization of configuration input could allow command injection. On sites where the TeX filter is enabled and ImageMagick is installed, a maliciously crafted setting value entered by an administrator could result in unintended system command execution. While exploitation requires administrative privileges, successful compromise could affect the entire Moodle server.",
