  "Description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to 9.1.2148, a stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Vim's NetBeans integration when processing the specialKeys command, affecting Vim builds that enable and use the NetBeans feature. The Stack buffer overflow exists in special_keys() (in src/netbeans.c). The while (*tok) loop writes two bytes per iteration into a 64-byte stack buffer (keybuf) with no bounds check. A malicious NetBeans server can overflow keybuf with a single specialKeys command. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.2148.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e Because of compiler hardening in Ubuntu, this stack overflow is",
    "mdeslaur\u003e limited to a denial of service only, when connecting to a",
    "mdeslaur\u003e malicious NetBeans server."
