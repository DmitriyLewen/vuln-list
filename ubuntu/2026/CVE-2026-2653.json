  "Description": "A security flaw has been discovered in admesh up to 0.98.5. This issue affects the function stl_check_normal_vector of the file src/normals.c. Performing a manipulation results in heap-based buffer overflow. The attack must be initiated from a local position. The exploit has been released to the public and may be used for attacks. It looks like this product is not really maintained anymore.",
