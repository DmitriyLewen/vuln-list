  "Description": "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name vulnerability in Apache Shiro. This issue affects Apache Shiro: before 2.0.7. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7, which fixes the issue. The issue only effects static files. If static files are served from a case-insensitive filesystem, such as default macOS setup, static files may be accessed by varying the case of the filename in the request. If only lower-case (common default) filters are present in Shiro, they may be bypassed this way. Shiro 2.0.7 and later has a new parameters to remediate this issue shiro.ini: filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true application.propertie: shiro.caseInsensitive=true Shiro 3.0.0 and later (upcoming) makes this the default.",
