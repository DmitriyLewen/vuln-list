  "Description": "Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2, when ast_coredumper writes its gdb init and output files to a directory that is world-writable (for example /tmp), an attacker with write permission(which is all users on a linux system) to that directory can cause root to execute arbitrary commands or overwrite arbitrary files by controlling the gdb init file and output paths. This issue has been patched in versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2.",
