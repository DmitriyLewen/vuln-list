  "Description": "Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an SPDP packet sent by a publisher causes a heap buffer overflow, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If the fields of `PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN` or `PID_PERMISSIONS_TOKEN` in the DATA Submessage — specifically by tampering with the `str_size` value read by `readString` (called from `readBinaryProperty`) — are modified, a 32-bit integer overflow can occur, causing `std::vector::resize` to use an attacker-controlled size and quickly trigger heap buffer overflow and remote process term ination. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 patch the issue.",
