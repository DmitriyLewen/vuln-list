  "Description": "Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an SPDP packet sent by a publisher causes an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) condition, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If t he fields of PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN or PID_PERMISSION_TOKEN in the DATA Submessage — specifically by tampering with the length field in readBinaryPropertySeq — are modified, an integer overflow occurs, leading to an OOM during the resize operation. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 patch the issue.",
