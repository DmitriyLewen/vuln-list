  "Description": "A flaw was found in moodle. This formula injection vulnerability occurs when data fields are exported without proper escaping. A remote attacker could exploit this by providing malicious data that, when exported and opened in a spreadsheet, allows arbitrary formulas to execute. This can lead to compromised data integrity and unintended operations within the spreadsheet.",
